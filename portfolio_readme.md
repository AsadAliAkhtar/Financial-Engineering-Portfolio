Welcome to my Financial Engineering portfolio! This repository showcases my applied work in quantitative finance, portfolio optimization, and computational methods in finance.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Asad Ali Akhtar**, currently pursuing a **Master's in Financial Engineering** at **WorldQuant University**. This portfolio demonstrates my practical understanding of financial theory, quantitative methods, and programming skills applied to real-world financial problems.

I'm passionate about building robust, data-driven solutions for portfolio management and risk analysis. My work combines rigorous mathematical frameworks with clean, reproducible code.

**Future Goals:**
- Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)
- Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF)

## 📚 Projects

### 1. [Black-Litterman Portfolio Allocation](./Black-Litterman-Portfolio-Allocation)

**Status:** ✅ Completed

An implementation of the Black-Litterman model that combines market equilibrium returns with investor-specific views to generate optimal portfolio allocations.

**Key Features:**
- Market-implied equilibrium returns from market capitalization weights
- Integration of both absolute and relative investor views
- Bayesian framework for combining prior beliefs with subjective forecasts
- Optimization using Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Quadratic Utility

**Technical Stack:**
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- PyPortfolioOpt for optimization
- yfinance for market data
- FRED API for risk-free rate data

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Advanced portfolio theory (CAPM, Bayesian methods)
- Optimization under constraints
- Financial data acquisition and preprocessing
- Professional documentation and visualization

**Status:** ✅ Completed

Implementation of Markowitz mean-variance optimization framework using both constrained and unconstrained approaches.

**Key Features:**
- Minimum-Variance Portfolio (MVP) construction
- Efficient Frontier generation and analysis
- Comparison of constrained vs. unconstrained portfolios
- Maximum return portfolio at target volatility

**Technical Stack:**
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
