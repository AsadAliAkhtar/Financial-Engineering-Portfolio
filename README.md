## 📚 Projects

### 1. [Black-Litterman Portfolio Allocation](./Black-Litterman%20Portfolio%20Allocation)

An implementation of the Black-Litterman model that combines market equilibrium returns with investor-specific views to generate optimal portfolio allocations.

**Key Features:**
- Market-implied equilibrium returns from market capitalization weights
- Integration of both absolute and relative investor views
- Bayesian framework for combining prior beliefs with subjective forecasts
- Optimization using Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Quadratic Utility

---

### 2. [Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization](./Mean-Variance%20Optimization)

Implementation of Markowitz mean-variance optimization framework using both constrained and unconstrained approaches.

**Key Features:**
- Minimum-Variance Portfolio (MVP) construction
- Efficient Frontier generation and analysis
- Comparison of constrained vs. unconstrained portfolios
- Maximum return portfolio at target volatility
